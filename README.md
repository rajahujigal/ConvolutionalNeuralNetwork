## General Information
Background:
Melanoma is one of the most dangerous types of skin cancer. Early detection is critical for increasing survival rates.
Business Problem:
Traditional detection methods require expert dermatologists, which may not always be accessible. This project aims to use AI-driven image classification to assist in melanoma detection.
Dataset Used:
The dataset consists of dermoscopic images of skin lesions. It is split into training, validation, and testing sets for model development.


## Conclusions
Model Performance: The CNN model achieved improved accuracy with data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning.
Overfitting Prevention: Implementing Dropout (0.4-0.5) and Batch Normalization helped reduce overfitting.
Challenges Faced: Class imbalance and limited dataset size made it difficult to achieve high generalization.
Future Improvements: Using transfer learning (ResNet, MobileNet) and larger datasets can further enhance performance.



## Technologies Used
TensorFlow 2.x – For building and training CNN models.
Keras – High-level deep learning API.
